# üß© DEFI SIMULATOR

## üóûÔ∏è What is Defi Simulator?

A full-stack decentralized finance (DeFi) simulation platform that mimics real-world token swaps using live market data from the 1inch aggregation protocol ‚Äî all without requiring actual blockchain transactions.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

- Authenticates users using JWT-based login/registration
- Initializes a virtual wallet with:
  - 10 ETH + 10 USDC on Ethereum
  - 10 USDC on Polygon
- Uses 1inch's `swap`, `spot price`, and `token` APIs to simulate swaps with live data
- Supports:
  - **Classic swaps** (e.g., ETH ‚Üí DAI on Ethereum)
  - **Cross-chain swaps** (e.g., USDC on Polygon ‚Üí ETH on Ethereum)
- Updates wallet balances to reflect the swap outcome
- Shows real-world swap behavior: price impact, slippage, and route variations
- Does **not** execute actual on-chain transactions or require MetaMask

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **User Auth:** Users register/login through a simple backend using JWT. Sessions are persisted client-side using localStorage.
2. **Wallet Simulation:** On first login, a wallet is created and seeded with preset balances. All balances are stored and updated off-chain(Postgresql).
3. **Token Fetching:** The app uses 1inch's Token API to retrieve supported tokens and metadata (symbol, decimals, address).
4. **Swap Execution:**
   - For classic swaps: 1inch‚Äôs Swap and Quote APIs are called to calculate realistic output amounts and simulate token routing.
   - For cross-chain swaps: 1inch‚Äôs cross-chain endpoints are used to determine transfer equivalents.
5. **Balance Update:** After a simulated swap, balances are updated based on returned values, including consideration for slippage and routing inefficiencies.
6. **Precision Handling:** Inbuilt wallet utility functions are used for accurate handling of decimals, especially between assets like ETH (18 decimals) and USDC (6 decimals).
